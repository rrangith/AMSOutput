# AMSOutput
Gets part number and designator from Excel file and looks for the same designator in the CSV file.

If it is found, the program will change the CSV file's part number and replace it with the part number found in the Excel file.

When it is done, the updated file will be saved in the same directory as the 2 files entered and will automatically open.
